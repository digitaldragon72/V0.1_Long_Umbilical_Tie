# V0.1_Long_Umbilical_Tie

I noticed that the umbilical for my V0.1 build would push against the A/B belts when the X/Y gantry was homed or moving around the back half of the print area. To remediate this, I took imported the existing Cable_Tie_x1.STL file into TinkerCAD and modified it by copying it and joining the two together still keeping the necessary distance for the interference fit with the cutout in the motor panel. For the shorter of the two files I simply cut between the two ziptie channels. I am running the longer version now with the umbilical ziptied above and below the motor panel and the reverse bowden tube tied to prevent excess movement.
